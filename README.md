# NextLevelWeek4
Application referent to NextLevelWeek #4 event hosted by Rocketseat

Made with Javascript, NextJS and ReactJS.

This application has the goal to help people that work for long periods of time in front of a computer to be healthier. It has a
25 minutes timer (when you should be working/studying) and when the timer is done the application proposes a challenge that you
should complete, it can be an body exercise or an eye exercise. If you manage to complete it you get an certain amount of
experience that you can accumulate to level up.

Additional features (compared to normal project from Rocketseat):
- Users can use their github account name to personalize the image and name that's shwon in the application;
- This version is more loyal to the original pomodoro clock, it has a cicle of 25 minutes of work with 5 minutes of rest instead
of just a challenge like in the original project;
- Fixed a bug in the bar that would turn it all green the first time the app was open.
